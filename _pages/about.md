Hi, I am Jo from Taiwan.<br>
I am a music lover and enjoy going concerts, music festivals!


## Why I came to Japan
I love Japanese culture and Japanese rock music. Before working holiday, I have visited Japan for several times. After 1 year of working holiday, I planned to stay in Japan for working, so I entered a 2-year college school majoring in tourism.

Due to the pandemic of COVID-19, the inbound tourism industry is impacted. I made a career shift back to be a web developer and learned Python/Django on my own.

Now I am working as a PHP/Laravel programmer in Kyoto.
