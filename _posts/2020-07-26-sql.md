This post is a note for what I have learned from [codecademy - Learn SQL](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql).

## Malupulation

### create table

```sql
-- This SQL is to create a new table
CREATE TABLE table_name (
   column_1 data_type, 
   column_2 data_type, 
   column_3 data_type
);
```

### insert data

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column_1, column_2, column_3) 
VALUES (value_1, value_2, value_3);
```

### select data

```sql
SELECT column FROM table_name;
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

### add new column: alter

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD COLUMN column_name data_type;
```

### update data

```sql
UPDATE table_name 
SET column = value 
WHERE condition; 
```

### delete data

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name 
WHERE condition;
```

### condition WHERE

```sql
WHERE PK = pk_value; 
WHERE column IS NULL;
WHERE column IS NOT NULL;

WHERE year BETWEEN 1990 AND 1999;
WHERE name BETWEEN 'A' AND 'J';
```

### constraint

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
   id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, 
   column_1 TEXT UNIQUE,
   column_2 TEXT NOT NULL,
   column_3 TEXT DEFAULT default_value
);
```

## Queries

```sql
SELECT name AS 'Titles'
FROM movies;
```

`AS` is a keyword in SQL that allows you to *rename* a column or table using an alias.

### distinct

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT tools 
FROM inventory;
```

`DISTINCT` is used to return unique values in the output

### like

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM movies
WHERE name LIKE 'Se_en';
```

`Se_en` : The `_` means you can substitute any individual character here without breaking the pattern

The names `Seven` and `Se7en` both match this pattern

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM movies
WHERE name LIKE 'A%';
```

`A%` : `%` is a wildcard character that matches zero or more missing letters in the pattern

- `A%` matches all movies with names that begin with letter ‘A’
- `%A` matches all movies that end with ‘A’

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM movies 
WHERE name LIKE '%man%';
```

Any movie that *contains* the word ‘man’ in its name will be returned
`LIKE` is not case sensitive. ‘Batman’ and ‘Man of Steel’ will both appear in the result of the query above

### case

It is SQL’s way of handling if-then logic.

```sql
SELECT name,
 CASE
  WHEN imdb_rating > 8 THEN 'Fantastic'
  WHEN imdb_rating > 6 THEN 'Poorly Received'
  ELSE 'Avoid at All Costs'
 END AS 'Review'
FROM movies;
```

## Aggregate functions

### count()

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM table_name;
```

calculate how many rows are in a table is to use the `COUNT()` function

### sum() / min() / max() / avg()

```sql
SELECT SUM(downloads)
FROM fake_apps;
```

### round()

```sql
SELECT ROUND(price, 0)
FROM fake_apps;
```

SQL rounds the values in the column to 0 decimal places in the output

### group by

```sql
SELECT ROUND(imdb_rating),
   COUNT(name)
FROM movies
GROUP BY ROUND(imdb_rating)
ORDER BY ROUND(imdb_rating);
```

- `1` is the first column selected
- `2` is the second column selected
- `3` is the third column selected

So the SQL could be adjusted like
```sql
SELECT ROUND(imdb_rating),
   COUNT(name)
FROM movies
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```

[Using group by on multiple columns](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2421388/using-group-by-on-multiple-columns)

#### having

SQL allows you to filter which groups to include and which to exclude by using `having`

```sql
SELECT year,
   genre,
   COUNT(name)
FROM movies
GROUP BY 1, 2
HAVING COUNT(name) > 10;
```

## Multiple tables

- *Primary key* is a column that serves a unique identifier for the rows in the table.
- *Foreign key* is a column that contains the primary key to another table

### join

#### inner join

Add some content

```sql
SELECT orders.order_id,
   customers.customer_name
FROM orders
JOIN customers
  ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;
```

 A simple `JOIN` (often called an *inner join*) our result only includes rows that match our `ON` condition

<img src="/images/SQL/inner-join.gif" alt="inner-join" style="zoom:30%;" />

A *left join* will keep all rows from the first table, regardless of whether there is a matching row in the second table

<img src="/images/SQL/left-join.gif" alt="left-join" style="zoom:30%;" />

#### cross join

combine all rows of one table with all rows of another table

```sql
SELECT shirts.shirt_color,
   pants.pants_color
FROM shirts
CROSS JOIN pants;
```

If we have 3 different shirts (white, grey, and olive) and 2 different pants (light denim and black), the results might look like this:

| shirt_color | pants_color |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| white       | light denim |
| white       | black       |
| grey        | light denim |
| grey        | black       |
| olive       | light denim |
| olive       | black       |

### union

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table1
UNION
SELECT *
FROM table2;
```

SQL has strict rules for appending data:

- Tables must have the same number of columns.
- The columns must have the same data types in the same order as the first table.

### with

```sql
WITH previous_query AS (
SELECT customer_id,
       COUNT(subscription_id) as subscriptions
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id)

SELECT customers.customer_name,
previous_query.subscriptions
FROM customers
JOIN previous_query
	ON customers.customer_id = previous_query.customer_id;
```

`WITH` statement allows us to perform a separate query
