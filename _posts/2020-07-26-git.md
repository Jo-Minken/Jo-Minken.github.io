This post is a note for what I have learned from [codecademy - Learn Git](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git).

## Backtrack

### HEAD

```
$ git show HEAD
```

In Git, the commit you are currently on is known as the `HEAD` commit

#### restore: checkout

```
$ git checkout HEAD filename
```

restore the file in your working directory to look exactly as it did when you last made a commit

#### unstage: reset

```
$ git reset HEAD filename
```

unstage that file from the staging area

#### set Head to previous command: reset SHA

```
$ git reset commit_SHA

$ git reset 5d69206
```

This command works by using the first 7 characters of the SHA of a previous commit

## Branch
### branch
```
$ git branch
* master
```

In the output, the `*` (asterisk) is showing you what branch you’re on. 

#### new branch

```
$ git branch new_branch
```

#### checkout branch

```
$ git checkout branch_name
Switched to branch 'branch_name'
```

#### merge other branch into now working branch

```
$ git merge branch_name
```

#### solve merge conflict

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
master version of line
=======
branch to merge version of line
>>>>>>$ branch_name
```

Delete **all of Git’s special markings** including the words `HEAD` and `branch_name`
If any of Git’s markings remain, for example, `>>>>>>>` and `=======`, the conflict remains

#### delete branch

```
$ git branch -d branch_name
```

## Teamwork

### clone

```
$ git clone remote_location clone_name
```

#### check remote origin

```
$ git remote -v
origin    the-git-origin-path (fetch)
origin    the-git-origin-path (push)
```

#### fetch and merge

```
$ git fetch
$ git merge origin/master
```

bring the changes down to your local copy

#### push

```
$ git push origin your_branch_name
```
